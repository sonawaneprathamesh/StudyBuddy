# StudyBuddy
We are a team here to help engineers. Engineers who want internships, previous year question papers, free courses, Career guidance and many more.
I have created a project in web development, which primarily focuses on helping engineering students save time and gain efficient knowledge through available resources. The name of the project is 'StudyBuddy.' Within this project, various sections are available, including university previous year papers, internship opportunities, technical/cultural events, free/paid certifications, and career roadmaps. These resources are immensely helpful for students in their studies.
